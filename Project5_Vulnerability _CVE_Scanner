# Vulnerability & CVE Scanner (SYNTECXHUB Internship Project)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship task at **SYNTECXHUB**. The goal was to build a lightweight tool capable of identifying potential security risks by analyzing service banners and mapping them to known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

## 🛠️ What I Built
I developed a Python-based scanner that automates the reconnaissance and analysis phases of a vulnerability assessment. 

### Key Features:
* **Service Detection:** Uses socket programming to perform "Banner Grabbing" from remote servers.
* **Version Extraction:** Employs Regular Expressions (Regex) to parse raw data into usable software versions.
* **CVE Intelligence:** Cross-references detected versions against a simulated vulnerability database.
* **Automated Reporting:** Outputs findings into a structured text file for security triage.

## 🚀 How to Use It
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the script via terminal: `python scanner.py`.
3. The script will analyze the target service (e.g., Apache 2.4.41).
4. Review the generated `scan_report.txt` for findings.

## ✅ Expected Outcomes
The script successfully identifies the software version and, if a match is found in the database, provides:
- **CVE ID:** The unique identifier for the vulnerability.
- **Severity Level:** (e.g., CRITICAL, HIGH).
- **Remediation:** Specific steps to fix the issue (e.g., Updating to a patched version).
