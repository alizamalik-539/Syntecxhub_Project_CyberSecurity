# Automated SQL Injection Scanner 🛡️

A professional Python-based security tool developed during my Cybersecurity Internship at **Syntecxhub**. This script is designed to automate the process of probing web inputs for SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project fulfills the requirements for **Project 1** of the Syntecxhub Internship. It uses a custom-built scanning engine to detect database error signatures in server responses, helping developers identify and remediate security flaws.

### Key Features
- **Probing Engine**: Automatically tests common SQLi patterns (Single quote, Tautologies, Comment-based).
- **Session-Aware**: Uses authentication cookies (PHPSESSID) to scan protected areas of a web application.
- **Indicator Detection**: Specifically designed to catch MariaDB/MySQL syntax error leaks.
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates a detailed Vulnerability Assessment Report (VAR) with risk ratings and remediation steps.
- **Ethical Safeguards**: Includes rate-limiting and is configured for legal, local-host testing (DVWA).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**: `requests`, `time`
- **Environment**: XAMPP / Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
