🔒 Encrypted Multi-Client Chat App
A secure, real-time chat application built in Python that demonstrates core cybersecurity principles including Symmetric Encryption, TCP Networking, and Concurrency. This project was developed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship at SyntecxHub.

🎯 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a client/server environment where messages are protected against eavesdropping (Man-in-the-Middle attacks) using industry-standard encryption.

🚀 Features
AES-256 Encryption: Messages are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in CFB mode before being sent over the network.

TCP Socket Communication: Reliable data transfer using the Transmission Control Protocol.

Multi-Client Support: The server uses Python’s threading library to handle multiple simultaneous connections without blocking.

Safe IV Usage: Each message utilizes a unique, cryptographically secure Initialization Vector (IV) to prevent cryptographic pattern analysis.

Audit Logging: All incoming encrypted traffic is logged to a local file (chat_log.txt) for security forensics and monitoring.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Library: cryptography (for AES implementation)

Networking: socket (TCP/IP)

Concurrency: threading

📂 Project Structure
server.py: The multi-threaded listener that decrypts messages and logs traffic.

client.py: The interactive interface that encrypts user input and sends it to the server.

encryptor_test.py: A standalone script to verify encryption/decryption logic.

chat_log.txt: The automatically generated audit trail.
