This project is a secure, local credential management system built with Python. It solves the problem of "plain-text" storage by using industry-standard Symmetric Encryption. The application allows users to store, retrieve, and search for account credentials while ensuring that the data stored on the disk is fully encrypted and unreadable to unauthorized users.

🚀 Key Features
Strong Encryption: Utilizes the Fernet (AES-128) symmetric encryption standard from the cryptography library.

Master Password Protection: Implements a "Gatekeeper" login system; the vault cannot be accessed or decrypted without the correct Master Password.

Key Management: Features a separate keygen.py utility to generate and manage a unique .key file, demonstrating a professional approach to Secrets Management.

Search Functionality: Optimized logic to quickly find specific account credentials within the encrypted database without manual decryption of the entire file.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Language: Python 3.x

Security Library: cryptography.fernet

Storage Format: Secure text-based database (passwords.txt) using delimited cipher-text.

Authentication: Password-based access control logic.

📊 How to Use
Setup: Run python keygen.py to generate your unique secret.key file.

Login: Run python manager.py and enter the Master Password (admin).

Manage: Use the add command to encrypt a new password or view/search to decrypt and display existing ones.
